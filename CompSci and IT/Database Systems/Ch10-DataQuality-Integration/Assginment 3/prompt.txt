For this lab you will take the various entities and associative entities, created
from your normalization process and import them into MS SQL Server Management Studio.

To create each table with its columns (attributes), you will use
MS SQL Server Management Studio and the CREATE TABLE command.

Once you have created the tables, you will use the INSERT INTO command to populate
them with at least three rows of data (you make up the data yourself).

Turn in ALL your queries, each screen capture showing the result of each query and
each of your tables with all the data.



WHAT TO TURN IN:
- 1 WORD or PDF document that contains all teh screen capture of running EACH query separately.
- Below each screen, please identify the tables that are clearly marked by each screen at the
  bottom of the page - (underneath the sctrrn capture)
